DNS: domain name system

TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
__________________________

After typing a URL and pressing enter in the search bar…

The browser uses DNS lookup, which acts like a translator, to find the domain’s IP address

1. example.com (readable by humans)
2. 150.10.77.5 (readable by computers)

Then, the browser connects to the domain’s server. It initiates a TCP connection to ensure the data’s integrity.

The browser asks the server for the contents of the webpage by sending an HTTP request.

The server process the request, and responds with information and instructions, so the browser can display the webpage.
